# Data-Analytics-using-AIRBNB

ABSTRACT: Our project is about performing data analytics using the Airbnb dataset. The purpose of this project is to:

-> Compare prices based on regions
-> Analyze the price difference by room types.
-> Which type of AIRBNB building  has more value?  
-> Predict the room types based on factors like price, location, number of nights. 
(gives an idea for those who want to host their property for investment purpose)

Various classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree and Random Forest were used to develop classification models
